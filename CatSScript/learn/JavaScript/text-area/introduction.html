<h1>Introduction and first steps</h1>
<br/>
<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p class="indent-1">
    JavaScript is the <span>programming language of the web</span>. <br/>
    It is used to program the <span>behavior</span> of web pages
</p>
<br/>
<h3>JavaScript Functions and Events</h3>
<p class="indent-1">
    A JavaScript script is made of <span>function</span>. <br/>
    A <code>function</code> is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for: most of the JavaScript Functions
    are <span>event handler</span> so they are called when an <span>event</span> (like the click of a user on a button) occurs.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>How to add JavaScript scripts</h3>
<p class="indent-1">
    In an HTML document, JavaScript code is inserted between <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> tags. <br/>
    If you want to link an external script you can use the following syntax: 
    <code>&lt;script src="<i>script_file_url</i>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> <br/>
    <br/>
    Scripts can be placed in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, or in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of an HTML page, or in both. <br/>
    Usually placing scripts at the bottom of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display;
    placing them at the end of the body section also helps them to work correctly because their interpretation is done after the whole web page has been charged. 
</p>

<h3>JavaScript Display Possibilities</h3>
<p class="indent-1">
    JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Writing into an HTML element, using <code>innerHTML</code> <br/>
            To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the <code>document.getElementById(id)</code> method. <br/>
            The <code>id</code> attribute defines the HTML element. The <code>innerHTML</code> property defines the HTML content.
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing into the HTML output using <code>document.write()</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing into an alert box, using <code>window.alert()</code> <br/>
            This method is used to create an alert box to display data. <br/>
            Note that you can skip the <code>window</code> keyword.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br/>
<h3>JavaScript Statements</h3>
<p class="indent-1">
    JavaScript statements are composed of <span>Values</span>, <span>Operators</span>, <span>Expressions</span>, <span>Keywords</span> and <span>Comments</span>. <br/>
    <br/>
    The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written. <br/>
    <span>Semicolons</span> separate JavaScript statements, this means that you must add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement. <br/>
    When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed. <br/>
    <br/>
    JavaScript <span>ignores multiple spaces</span>.
